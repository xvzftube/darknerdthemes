#darknerdthemes

I like to use dark themes when working. I like `gruvebox`, `nord`, and `everforest`. I think darkthemes could use a little more representation in the ggplot2 community. I do not follow the above themes strictly, I just hope to generate sensible dark themes. Please fork and make your own variations.

# Example

```
